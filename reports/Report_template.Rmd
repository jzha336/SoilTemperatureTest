<!-- START your report from here. This is a comment in Rmd -->

A good place to start with RMarkdown is with this [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). Using  **RStudio** will make your life easier.

# Introduction {-}
(A section that is not numbered)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-subfigure.html and the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).


Example of `eval = FALSE` chunk: this code will not be run but the code is shown.

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE}
# setting eval - FALSE means this will be not run but the code is shown
install.packages('ggplot2')
```


If you have some code that may take a while to run, you can save it as a .RData, and upload here to knit the report more efficiently, using the `load()` function.

# Analysis Step 1 - Data structure

## Data summary
some reference here
`https://modelsummary.com/vignettes/datasummary.html`
```{r step1}
# some R code
```

## Plots

You can also embed plot, include a caption, and cross-reference the figure.

For example in Figure \ref{fig:pressure}:

```{r pressure, echo = TRUE, fig.cap ='Cars data: plot of temperature (x-axis) vs pressure (y-axis)', out.width = '40%'}
plot(pressure)
```

Another example to include an external image in Figure \ref{fig:logo}

```{r logo, echo = FALSE, fig.cap ='Logo of PFR', out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('Figures/PFRLogo.png')
```

## Several plots

Including several plots in the same row allows to gain some space.

```{r my2plots, fig.show='hold', fig.cap ='Two logos of the package', fig.subcap= c('Subcaption 1', 'Subcaption 2'), out.width = '25%', fig.ncol = 2}
# here, changing the out.width compared to the global options
knitr::include_graphics(c('Figures/PFRLogo.png', 'Figures/PFRLogo.png'))
```


```{r my3plots, fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Three figures", fig.ncol = 3, fig.subcap= c('A scatterplot', 'Another scatterplot', 'Boxplots'), out.width = '25%'}
plot(1:10)
plot(cars, pch = 19)
boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
```

# Reproduceable 
Good practice is to finish the document with the versions of all the packages you have used, for reproducibility purpose (we will not count this as part of the number of allocated pages!):

```{r}
sessionInfo()
